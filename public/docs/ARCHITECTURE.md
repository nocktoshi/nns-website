# 1. Current canonical status
## 1.1 Decision
NNS uses:
> **Path A: Nockchain as sequencer**, with the `nns-gate` upgrade to provable claim transitions.
That means:
- Nockchain provides canonical ordering of claim notes.
- NNS kernels replay those chain-ordered inputs deterministically.
- Vesl/STARK proofs make the resulting registry state stateless-verifiable by wallets.
- Wallets trust Nockchain independently, not an NNS server.
This is the full zkRollup shape:

```text
Nockchain orders inputs
NNS applies deterministic state transitions
STARK proves the transition / claim facts
Wallet verifies proof + checks Nockchain anchor freshness
```
## 1.2 Current production proof path
Current proof path is **Phase 3c step 2**, also called the **committed-digest / option-B recursion design**.
Wallet flow today:
```text
wallet receives (bundle, claim_proof_blob)
  ├── verify_stark(claim_proof_blob)
  │     STARK says digest = X
  ├── recompute belt-digest(jam(bundle)) == X
  │     local hash check
  └── validate-claim-bundle(bundle) == Ok
        wallet-side Rust mirror
```
All three checks must pass.
The STARK verify + digest check reduces the trust surface to:
> “Vesl STARK is sound, and this bundle is exactly the bundle the kernel committed to.”
The wallet-side validator is still required because full validator execution inside the STARK is currently blocked upstream in Vesl.
## 1.3 Pre-production blocker — **LIFTED (Phase 7 shipped 2026-04-24)**
Phase 7's freshness enforcement has shipped end-to-end:
- **Kernel side**: `claim-bundle` now carries `anchored-tip-height`. `%prove-claim` refuses to emit a proof unless the bundle's anchor matches the kernel's current `(tip-digest, tip-height)` — new `%anchor-mismatch` validation error short-circuits before the prover runs.
- **API side**: `GET /proof` now returns a `ProofAnchor { tip_digest, tip_height }` object alongside the Merkle proof.
- **Wallet side**: `src/freshness.rs` exposes `Freshness::check` + `check_anchor_binding`; `src/bin/light_verify.rs` adds `--chain-tip`, `--max-staleness` (default 20), and `--chain-tip-digest` flags with precise exit codes (1=merkle, 2=stale, 3=fork, 4=missing anchor, 5=missing chain-tip).
- **Tests**: 2 kernel-level anchor-mismatch tests, 13 freshness unit tests, 8 CLI integration tests, 2 two-server stale-proof integration tests. All green.
The attack this closes: a malicious NNS server freezes its follower and hand-pokes stale kernel state. The proof is cryptographically valid but anchored at an old view. Without wallet-side freshness enforcement, naive clients would accept it. With Phase 7, the wallet compares the proof's `anchor.tip_height` to its own canonical-chain view and rejects anything more than `max_staleness` blocks behind.
See [Staleness and fork resistance](#7-staleness-and-fork-resistance) for the full three-layer defense and the attack walk-through.
## 1.4 Current upstream blocker
Phase 3c step 3 — running the validator entirely inside the STARK — is blocked by Vesl’s STARK prover interpreter.
`common/ztd/eight.hoon::fock:fink:interpret` supports only Nock opcodes **0–8**.
These opcodes currently trap:
```hoon
[%9 axis=* core=*]              !!
[%10 [axis=@ value=*] target=*] !!
[%11 tag=@ next=*]              !!
[%11 [tag=@ clue=*] next=*]     !!
```
The NNS validator formula uses:
- Nock 9: slam a gate / arm.
- Nock 10: edit a core sample.
- Nock 11: emitted by Hoon hints in some compiled forms.
Raw nockvm supports these opcodes. Vesl’s STARK prover interpreter does not.
Current decision:
- Keep production on Phase 3c step 2.
- File upstream ask for Vesl opcode 9/10/11 support.
- Keep the NNS blocker-signal test in place.
- Formula-rewriting workarounds (Hoon-side pre-expansion or inline rewrites inside `fock:fink:interpret`) were attempted and rejected on OOM grounds — geometric trace blowup from recursive Nock-9 expansion. See [10.10](#1010-path-3-attempt-formula-rewriting).

# 2. Consensus decision
## 2.1 The problem
The current NNS kernel enforces name uniqueness locally.
In `hoon/app/app.hoon`:
```hoon
?:  (~(has by names.state) name.c)
  :_  state
  ~[[%claim-error 'name already registered']]
```
That is rule **C3**.
It checks the local kernel’s own `names` map. A different kernel on another machine has its own independent `names` map.
Without a canonical input order, two nodes can both accept conflicting claims.
Example:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Alice
    participant NodeA as NNS node A
    participant Chain as Nockchain
    participant NodeB as NNS node B
    participant Bob
    Alice->>NodeA: POST /claim 0.nock -> Alice
    Bob->>NodeB: POST /claim 0.nock -> Bob
    Note over NodeA: C3 passes: names map empty locally
    Note over NodeB: C3 passes: names map empty locally
    NodeA->>NodeA: %vesl-register hull=H(1) root=R_A
    NodeB->>NodeB: %vesl-register hull=H(1) root=R_B
    NodeA->>Chain: settle note_A, root=R_A, 0.nock=Alice
    NodeB->>Chain: settle note_B, root=R_B, 0.nock=Bob
    Note over Chain: accepts both. Different note IDs, no cross-note invariant.
```
At the end, the chain has two valid settlement notes.
Each proof is locally truthful:
- `R_A` really contains `0.nock -> Alice`.
- `R_B` really contains `0.nock -> Bob`.
The missing piece is not proof correctness. The missing piece is:
> A canonical ordering of `%claim` inputs that every node observes and replays identically.
Bitcoin solves this with longest-chain transaction ordering. Ethereum solves it with block order. NNS uses Nockchain order.
## 2.2 Chosen model: Path A
A claim is no longer authoritative because it hit one HTTP server.
Instead:
1. User sends a payment / claim note to Nockchain.
2. Nockchain orders that note in a block.
3. Every NNS follower observes the same ordered note stream.
4. Every NNS kernel replays the same `%claim` inputs in the same order.
5. Conflicts resolve deterministically by C3.
Flow:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Hull as NNS hull
    participant Chain as Nockchain
    participant Kernel as NNS kernel
    Client->>Hull: POST /claim 0.nock -> Alice
    Hull->>Chain: submit tagged claim-note
    Chain-->>Hull: confirmed in block N via follower
    Hull->>Kernel: %claim name=0.nock owner=Alice
    Kernel-->>Hull: %claimed or C3 error
    Hull-->>Client: confirmed or rejected status
```
## 2.3 Resulting system
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Client[Wallet or light client]
    Hull[NNS hull]
    Chain[Nockchain]

    Hull -->|"post transition proof"| Chain
    Client -->|"GET /proof?name=..."| Hull
    Hull -->|"inclusion + transition STARK"| Verifier
    Verifier -->|"verify vs chain headers"| Chain
```
## 2.4 Why this decision won
Path A with the `nns-gate` upgrade gives:
- Canonical ordering from Nockchain.
- Deterministic NNS state transitions.
- No new validator set.
- Stateless wallet verification.
- No trust in the queried NNS server.
- A natural zkRollup architecture.
Important design point:
> Path A alone gives canonical ordering.  
> Path A + upgraded `nns-gate` gives stateless light-client verification.

# 3. What Vesl provides, and what it does not
Vesl is a verification SDK / STARK stack. It is not a consensus protocol.
## 3.1 Vesl provides
- Merkle commitment over `names` via `compute-root`.
- A STARK-provable gate, `nns-gate`.
- G1 / G2 proof surface:
  - G1: name format.
  - G2: Merkle inclusion.
- Local graft history:
  - `registered = (map hull root)`.
- Batch replay guard:
  - `settled = (set note-id)`.
- Settlement-note publishing mechanism to Nockchain.
## 3.2 Vesl does not provide
Vesl does not provide:
- Cross-node agreement on `names`.
- A canonical root.
- Ordering of `%claim` inputs.
- Protection against double-registration across independent kernels.
Two kernels can produce two valid roots and two valid proofs. Vesl does not decide which root is canonical.
## 3.3 Why provable claim transitions are necessary but insufficient alone
Widening `nns-gate` so it proves C1/C2/C3/C4 transitions is necessary.
But by itself, it does not solve consensus.
Node A can prove:
```text
empty registry -> Alice claims 0.nock -> R_A
```
Node B can prove:
```text
empty registry -> Bob claims 0.nock -> R_B
```
Both traces are internally valid.
The missing ingredient remains: **which input sequence is canonical?**
Nockchain supplies that sequence.
## 3.4 What “verify on chain” means on Nockchain
Nockchain is not a smart-contract chain.
It provides:
- PoW ordering.
- Data availability for tagged notes.
- Value transfer.
- Fixed lock primitives:
  - `Pkh`
  - `Tim`
  - `Hax`
  - `Burn`
It does **not** execute arbitrary NNS logic.
So “verify” splits into:
1. **The chain runs NNS logic.**  
   Not possible on Nockchain.
2. **Every user runs a full NNS replayer.**  
   Works, but bad wallet UX.
3. **A third party verifies NNS state without replaying everything.**  
   Requires STARK proofs. This is Vesl’s role.
## 3.5 Vesl’s role in Path A
| System shape | Vesl proves | Problem |
|---|---|---|
| Centralized kernel today | Rows are in a root | Root may not be canonical |
| Path A without Vesl | Chain-ordered replay is canonical | Wallet must replay or trust server |
| Path A with current G1/G2 gate | Rows are in committed root | Wallet still trusts server applied log honestly |
| Path A with upgraded gate | Chain-ordered claims folded into root correctly | Desired zkRollup model |

# 4. Solution space considered
## 4.1 A. Nockchain as sequencer
Mechanism:
- Claim is a Nockchain note, e.g. `nns/v1/claim`.
- Note carries:
  - `name`
  - `owner`
  - `tx-hash`
  - fee/payment reference
- Every node runs a `ChainFollower`.
- Follower scans Nockchain in canonical block order.
- Follower pokes `%claim` into the local kernel in that order.
- HTTP `POST /claim` becomes a convenience around constructing and submitting the note.
Properties:
| Axis | Path A |
|---|---|
| Finality | 1 block, plus chosen finality depth |
| Cost per claim | chain gas + fee, usually same tx |
| Operational complexity | moderate |
| Trust assumption | Nockchain |
| Kernel changes | minimal |
| Reorg handling | required |
| Migration | additive |
| `claim-id` ladder | survives |
| `nns-gate` | survives, then gets upgraded |
Failure modes:
- Chain unreachable → request returns 503.
- Reorg → follower rewinds kernel to checkpoint and replays.
- Submission race → resolved by chain order.
## 4.2 B. Commit-reveal on chain
Mechanism:
- Commit: post `hash(name, owner, nonce)`.
- Reveal later: post actual claim.
- Ordering is by commit note.
Properties:
| Axis | Path B |
|---|---|
| Finality | at least 2 blocks |
| Cost | 2 chain transactions |
| Complexity | Path A + timeout/reveal protocol |
| Trust | Nockchain |
| Main benefit | mempool front-running protection |
Decision:
- Treat B as a future modifier on A.
- Not needed for v1 unless `.nock` front-running becomes material.
## 4.3 C. Independent BFT appchain
Mechanism:
- Separate validator set orders NNS claims.
- Validators run NNS kernel as deterministic state machine.
- Periodic Vesl commitments posted to Nockchain.
Properties:
| Axis | Path C |
|---|---|
| Finality | sub-second to seconds |
| Cost | amortized settlement |
| Complexity | high |
| Trust | honest 2/3 validator set |
| Migration | heavy |
| Product impact | effectively building a new chain |
Decision:
- Rejected for now.
- Reconsider only if:
  - Path A latency is unacceptable,
  - per-claim gas is prohibitive,
  - and a credible operator set exists.
## 4.4 D. Rollup with sequencer + fraud proofs
Mechanism:
- One sequencer orders HTTP claims.
- Sequencer posts batches to Nockchain.
- Challenge window allows fraud proofs.
Properties:
| Axis | Path D |
|---|---|
| Finality | soft immediately, hard after challenge window |
| Cost | amortized |
| Complexity | medium-high |
| Trust | one honest challenger + data availability |
| Failure modes | censorship, DA failure, mass challenges |
Decision:
- Rejected in favor of zk variant of Path A.
- STARK finality is better for name-registry UX than fraud windows.
## 4.5 Comparison table
| Axis | A | B | C | D |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Finality | 1 block | 2 blocks | sub-second to seconds | soft fast / hard after challenge |
| Cost per claim | 1 chain tx + fee | 2 chain txs + fee | amortized | amortized |
| New protocol code | small/moderate | A + commit-reveal | large | medium-large |
| Trust | Nockchain | Nockchain | honest 2/3 validators | honest challenger + DA |
| `claim-id` ladder | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| `nns-gate` | yes | yes | yes | yes, plus fraud-specific work |
| Chosen? | **yes** | later if needed | no | no |

# 5. Proof-storage model
## 5.1 Core claim
NNS does **not** store Nockchain.
NNS stores:
- Registry rows.
- One anchored Nockchain tip.
NNS proves that a claim links into a chain the wallet already trusts.
The wallet verifies:
1. The STARK proof.
2. The NNS anchor against the wallet’s own Nockchain view.
## 5.2 Scenario
Alice registered:
```text
alice.nock -> alice-addr
```
Bob’s wallet wants to verify:
> Did `alice.nock` really get registered by `alice-addr`, and did that registration actually pay?
## 5.3 Data involved
| Data | Approx size | Stored by | Trust domain |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Alice registry row `(alice.nock, alice-addr, tx-hash=X)` | ~120 B | NNS kernel | kernel-owned |
| Nockchain block B containing tx X | ~100 KB | Nockchain nodes | chain-owned |
| NNS anchored tip T | 40 B digest + height | NNS kernel | kernel-owned |
| Nockchain canonical tip T′ | varies | wallet’s Nockchain view | wallet-owned |
NNS does not store:
- block B,
- transaction X,
- Nockchain tables,
- full header history.
Those travel with the proof bundle when needed.
## 5.4 Proof bundle shape
A server can answer Bob with:
```text
{
  claim:           { name: "alice.nock", owner: "alice-addr", tx_hash: X },
  registry_proof:  <Merkle proof of claim in NNS registry root R>,
  page:            <Nockchain block/page B: digest, height, parent, tx-ids>,
  block_proof:     <B's PoW STARK>,
  header_chain:    <parent headers from B up to T_nns>,
  raw_tx:          <actual transaction noun at X>,
  stark:           <recursive STARK proof covering these facts>
}
```
Future complete recursive proof statement:
```text
stark ⇒ ∃ (claim, R, page, block_proof, header_chain, raw_tx):
  claim ∈ registry_with_root(R)
  ∧ verify_pow(block_proof) = ok
  ∧ block_commitment(page) = block_proof.commitment
  ∧ compute_id(raw_tx) = claim.tx_hash
  ∧ claim.tx_hash ∈ page.tx_ids
  ∧ chain_links(page, header_chain, T_nns)
  ∧ pays_sender(raw_tx) = claim.owner
  ∧ pays_amount(raw_tx, treasury) ≥ fee
```
## 5.5 Wallet verification has two parts
### Part 1: verify the STARK
This is pure cryptographic verification.
The wallet does not trust the NNS server. It verifies that the proof attests to the claimed relationship between:
- claim,
- registry root,
- payment transaction,
- block page,
- block proof,
- header chain,
- NNS anchor.
### Part 2: verify the anchor point
The STARK says:
```text
claim anchors to T_nns at height H_nns
```
The wallet asks its own Nockchain source:
> Is digest `T_nns` at height `H_nns` in your canonical chain?
If yes, and freshness passes, accept.  
If no, reject.
## 5.6 Trust boundary
```text
┌─────────────────┐
│  Bob's wallet   │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ 1. verify STARK
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│ NNS STARK proof │
│ from any server │
└────────┬────────┘
         │
         │ 2. check T_nns against wallet's own Nockchain view
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│   Nockchain     │
│ wallet's source │
└─────────────────┘
```
NNS is not trusted for chain data. It only provides a cryptographic bridge.
## 5.7 Why NNS does not store headers
The slim-anchor refactor removed the old 1,024-header deque.
Kernel anchor state is now:
```text
[tip-digest tip-height]
```
Intermediate headers are validated on `%advance-tip` and then discarded.
Rationale:
> NNS is a zkRollup-on-Nockchain. Rollups do not re-encode their parent chain. They commit to one state root / anchor and rely on the parent chain as the trust base.
## 5.8 Where chain state is actually used
| Use | Source | Stored in kernel? |
|---|---|---|
| Chain linkage inside STARK | `header_chain` in proof bundle | no |
| Block PoW verification inside STARK | `block_proof` in proof bundle | no |
| Anchor binding | `tip-digest + tip-height` | yes, 48 B |
## 5.9 What the follower does
The hull background follower:
1. Every 10 seconds, asks Nockchain for current tip height.
2. Fetches up to 64 headers between current NNS anchor and `tip - finality_depth`.
3. Pokes `%advance-tip`.
4. Kernel validates parent linkage and heights.
5. Kernel stores only the new tip digest and height.
Defaults:
```text
DEFAULT_FINALITY_DEPTH = 10
DEFAULT_MAX_ADVANCE_BATCH = 64
poll interval = 10 s
```
## 5.10 Byte budget
Approximate future verification bundle for `alice.nock`:
| Artifact | Size | Source |
|---|---:|---|
| NNS STARK proof | ~100 KiB | NNS server |
| Block/page header | ~200 B | NNS server |
| Block PoW proof | ~75 KiB | NNS server |
| Header chain, avg 5 headers | ~440 B | NNS server |
| Raw tx noun | ~300 B | NNS server |
| Merkle inclusion proof | ~200 B | NNS server |
| One chain-view query | 1 RTT | wallet |
| NNS kernel storage needed | ~160 B per claim + 48 B anchor | kernel |

# 6. Current wallet verification flow
## 6.1 Current Phase 3c option-B proof
Current proof scaffolding has two pieces:
1. `validate-claim-bundle`
2. `%prove-claim`
The validator runs **outside** the STARK. The STARK commits to the bundle digest under the kernel’s current `(root, hull)`.
Current wallet flow:
```text
wallet receives (bundle, proof, bundle_digest)
1. verify STARK via verify:vesl-verifier
   confirms a kernel at (root, hull) committed bundle_digest
2. recompute belt-digest(jam(bundle))
   must equal bundle_digest
3. run validate_claim_bundle(bundle) locally
   must return Ok
4. check anchor/freshness against wallet's Nockchain view
```
## 6.2 What the current proof attests
Inside the STARK:
- A kernel committed at `(root, hull)` asserted this bundle digest.
- Fiat-Shamir binding prevents rebinding the proof to a different registry snapshot.
Specifically:
- `%prove-claim` validates the bundle first.
- If validation passes, it folds `(jam bundle)` into a belt digest.
- It calls `prove-computation:vp`.
- It emits:
```hoon
[%claim-proof bundle-digest proof]
```
Measured test:
```text
tests/prover.rs::phase3c_prove_claim_roundtrip
```
Manual ignored test metrics:
| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| prove | 4.997 s |
| verify | 615 ms |
| proof JAM | 76,537 B |
| peak RSS | 1.0 GB |
## 6.3 What current proof does not yet attest in-STARK
Wallet must still check externally:
- Validator predicates passed on the bundle.
- Bundle digest matches the supplied bundle.
- Payment semantics:
  - sender,
  - recipient,
  - amount.
- Full page commitment via `tx-witness.hoon`.
- Block PoW proof verification inside gate.
## 6.4 What step 3 upgrades
When validator execution runs inside the STARK:
Current checks:
```text
STARK verify
+ bundle digest check
+ Rust validator mirror
```
Become:
```text
STARK verify
+ optional/direct committed product check
```
The committed product becomes the validator output:
```hoon
[%& ~]              :: ok
[%| <validation-error>] :: rejected
```
The wallet SDK can drop the Rust validator mirror.
Current blocker: Vesl prover opcode support.

# 7. Staleness and fork resistance
## 7.1 The attack
Suppose:
1. Alice asks NNS server N1 to register `zero.nock`.
2. N1 is stale at Nockchain height 1000.
3. Nockchain is actually at height 1020.
4. Bob’s earlier payment for `zero.nock` landed between 1000 and 1020.
5. N1’s kernel has not replayed Bob yet.
6. A malicious operator manually pokes `%claim` for Alice.
7. N1 emits a STARK proof anchored at stale `T_nns`.
The proof may be cryptographically valid. It is honest about stale kernel state.
Naive wallet checks would pass:
- STARK verifies.
- Anchor exists somewhere in Nockchain history.
But Alice should not get ownership if Bob was first on-chain.
## 7.2 Layer 1: chain-ordered replay
`POST /claim` is not a commitment.
The handler:
1. Accepts payment tx / claim note.
2. Queues a pending claim.
3. Returns `Submitted`.
The kernel does not mutate `names` at request time.
The follower later replays claims in canonical chain order:
```text
(block_height, tx_index_in_block)
```
So honest-but-slow servers converge once they catch up.
## 7.3 Layer 2: frozen followers converge on replay
If a follower is stuck:
- Kernel state freezes.
- Claims remain `Submitted`.
- No proof should be issued.
When the follower restarts:
- It replays chain-ordered txs from its cursor.
- Earlier claims win.
- Later conflicting claims reject with C3.
This is liveness failure, not safety failure.
## 7.4 Layer 3: wallet freshness check
Malicious server bypass is closed by wallet-side freshness:
```text
proof.t_nns_height >= wallet.current_chain_tip_height - MAX_STALENESS
```
Default:
```text
MAX_STALENESS = 20 blocks
```
This should be:
```text
finality_depth + margin
```
Current finality depth default is 10 blocks.
## 7.5 Scenario walk-through
```text
Nockchain height 1000: chain tip T0
NNS N1 anchored at T0
NNS N2 anchored at T0
t=0:  Alice sends tx X_A for zero.nock
t=1:  Bob sends tx X_B for zero.nock
t=2:  block 1005 contains X_B
t=3:  Alice POST /claim to N1
t=4:  Bob POST /claim to N2
t=5:  block 1010 contains X_A
t=6:  chain tip = 1010
```
Case A — honest synced N1:
```text
N1 advances to 1010.
N1 replays X_B then X_A.
Bob accepted.
Alice rejected C3.
No bad proof.
```
Case B — frozen N1:
```text
N1 anchor stays 1000.
Alice remains Submitted.
No proof should be issued.
```
Case C — malicious N1:
```text
Operator manually pokes Alice into stale kernel.
Proof says T_nns_height = 1000.
Wallet at current_tip 1025 checks:
1000 < 1025 - 20 = 1005
Reject stale proof.
```
## 7.6 Phase 7 acceptance criteria — **SHIPPED 2026-04-24 pm**
Status per acceptance criterion:
| Criterion | Status | Landed in |
|---|---|---|
| Proof bundle carries `t_nns_digest: [u8; 40]` + `t_nns_height: u64` | **done** | `ProofAnchor` on `ProofResponse` in `src/types.rs`; surfaced from `/proof` in `src/api.rs` |
| Proof-bundle schema documented | **done** | Doc-comment on `ProofResponse.anchor` + this section |
| Kernel commits anchor into bundle cryptographically | **done** | `claim-bundle.anchored-tip-height` is part of `belt-digest(jam(bundle))` which the STARK's Fiat-Shamir absorbs via `%prove-claim`. Bundle-hash mismatch = proof-invalidation. |
| Kernel refuses mismatched bundles | **done** | New `%anchor-mismatch` error; `matches-current-anchor:np` predicate compares bundle anchor to kernel state before prove runs |
| `light_verify` `--max-staleness` (default 20) | **done** | `src/bin/light_verify.rs`, default wired to `freshness::DEFAULT_MAX_STALENESS = 20` |
| `light_verify` rejects stale proofs | **done** | exit code 2 via `Freshness::check`, unit-tested at boundary/above/below |
| Unit tests: boundary, above, below | **done** | `src/freshness.rs::tests` (13 tests including exact/one-above/one-below) |
| SDK docs: freshness rule, chain-tip source, verification snippet | **done (inline)** | Doc comments on `freshness::Freshness`, `ClaimBundle::check_freshness`, `ProofResponse.anchor`, and `light_verify --help` |
| Integration test: two servers, freeze one, advance chain, assert reject | **done** | `tests/phase7_two_servers.rs::two_servers_freshness_gate` (honest + frozen kernels, different anchors, light_verify accepts one, rejects the other) + `server_catches_up_proofs_become_fresh_again` (recovery flow) |
Remaining as future work (not blocking):
- Recursive `nns-gate` commitment into STARK public output (Phase 5): we currently bind via the bundle-digest absorbed into Fiat-Shamir. A follow-up can surface `t_nns_height` as a first-class public output once `nns-gate` grows transition-proof support.
- Dedicated `docs/wallet-verification.md` standalone guide: current docs are inline on types and `--help`. Standalone Markdown is helpful but not gating.
## 7.7 Operator observability — **Phase 7.1 shipped 2026-04-24 pm**
Shipped in `src/state.rs` (`FollowerObservability`), `src/chain_follower.rs`
(structured tracing + telemetry updates), and `src/api.rs` (status
augmentation, `/anchor`, `/admin/advance-tip-now`).
### /status augmentation
`GET /status` now returns an `anchor` object and a `follower` block:
```jsonc
{
  "settlement_mode": "local",
  "chain_endpoint": null,
  "anchor": { "tip_height": 120, "tip_digest": "42..." },
  "follower": {
    "chain_tip_height":            130,
    "anchor_lag_blocks":           10,
    "is_caught_up":                true,
    "last_advance_at_epoch_ms":    1735689600000,
    "last_advance_age_seconds":    23,
    "last_advance_tip_height":     120,
    "last_advance_count":          5,
    "last_chain_tip_observed_at_epoch_ms": 1735689610000,
    "last_error":                  null,
    "last_error_phase":            null,
    "last_error_at_epoch_ms":      null,
    "finality_depth":              10,
    "max_advance_batch":           64
  }
}
```
`anchor_lag_blocks = follower.chain_tip_height − anchor.tip_height`.
`is_caught_up = lag ≤ finality_depth + 1`. Both are computed
server-side so clients don't need the constants baked in.
### /anchor dedicated route
`GET /anchor` returns the same anchor + follower data as `/status.follower`
merged, and responds **503 SERVICE UNAVAILABLE** when the node has
neither a kernel anchor peek nor any chain-tip observation (truly blind).
This distinguishes "chain is at height 0" from "follower is broken and
we don't know anything" — important for monitoring.
### Structured follower tracing
All follower log lines now carry `phase` and `err` fields:
```
INFO  phase=anchor_advance tip_height=120 count=5  "chain follower advanced anchor"
WARN  phase=anchor_tick    err="header chain fetch failed [111..120]: ..."  "chain follower anchor tick failed"
WARN  phase=claim_tick     err="chain position lookup failed: ..."          "chain follower claim tick failed"
TRACE phase=anchor_advance                                                   "anchor tick no-op"
```
The five error phases the follower tags:
| phase | what failed |
|---|---|
| `anchor_peek`   | kernel `/anchor` peek returned error |
| `plan`          | `plan_anchor_advance` failed (chain-tip fetch, mostly) |
| `header_fetch`  | `fetch_header_chain` gRPC call failed |
| `advance_poke`  | kernel rejected `%advance-tip`, or no `%anchor-advanced` effect |
| `claim_tick`    | claim-replay tick encountered an error |
### /admin/advance-tip-now — manual advance trigger
`POST /admin/advance-tip-now` drives one `advance_anchor_once` pass
outside the regular 10 s poll cycle. Useful for:
- verifying a freshly-configured chain endpoint works
- unsticking an anchor without waiting for the next tick
- exercising the anchor-advance path in tests
**Gated by `NNS_ENABLE_ADMIN=1`.** Default is off so casually-deployed
nodes don't expose the mutation surface. Returns **404** when disabled
(so scanners can't fingerprint).
### Tests
Four new handler tests in `tests/handlers.rs`:
- `status_exposes_follower_observability_shape`
- `anchor_handler_returns_503_when_blind`
- `admin_advance_tip_returns_404_when_admin_disabled`
- `admin_advance_tip_is_noop_in_local_mode_when_enabled` (serialized
  with file-local mutex to protect the `NNS_ENABLE_ADMIN` env var)
### Operator runbook
Full walkthrough in [`docs/running_a_node.md`](docs/running_a_node.md):
install, configure, run, monitor. Covers local-mode → chain-mode
migration, common debug recipes, and suggested alert thresholds.
### Deferred (still roadmap)
- **Prometheus metrics endpoint** (`/metrics` in Prometheus text format).
  The telemetry fields are already in `/status.follower` as JSON —
  adding a `prometheus` feature flag + exporter is ~50 lines. Not
  blocking any user flow.
- **Old-pending-claim surfacing**. `/status.pending_count` exists;
  the "submitted > 10 minutes ago" breakdown doesn't. Add when the
  follower ships persistent claim replay (Phase 3 continued).

# 8. Recursive-STARK architecture and research findings
## 8.1 Current conclusion
Recursive STARK direction is a **GO**.
Updated conclusion after Phase 1-redo:
- Baseline NNS STARK prover works.
- Vesl verifier works for Vesl-style proofs.
- Verifier cost is modest enough that per-claim recursion is not ruled out.
- Per-batch recursion remains preferred for throughput.
- Full validator-in-STARK is blocked not by architecture, but by Vesl prover opcode support.
## 8.2 Historical initial finding: baseline did not exist yet
Early Phase 1 investigation found:
- `TransitionProofMetadata.transition_proof` was always `None`.
- `src/api.rs` returned metadata-first proof responses.
- NNS did not boot with prover hot state.
- Vesl forge path was expensive and marked ignored.
This led to an initial “Conditional GO” with a hard prerequisite:
1. Boot NNS with prover hot state.
2. Emit real proof bytes.
3. Wire proof bytes through API.
4. Benchmark.
5. Make benchmark reproducible.
That prerequisite has since been satisfied for baseline NNS proofs.
## 8.3 What Phase 1 covered
Phase 1 read and mapped:
- `nockchain/hoon/common/stark/verifier.hoon`
- `nockchain/hoon/common/tx-engine-0.hoon`
- `nockchain/hoon/common/tx-engine-1.hoon`
- `nockchain/hoon/common/zoon.hoon`
- `vesl/crates/vesl-core/src/forge.rs`
- NNS `src/api.rs`
- Vesl forge tests and diagnostic scripts.
Specifically mapped:
- `page`
- `hashable-block-commitment`
- `hashable-digest`
- `compute-digest`
- `block-commitment`
- `hashable-tx-ids`
- z-set inclusion via `has:z-in`
## 8.4 Verifier interface is recursion-ready
Nockchain verifier interface:
```hoon
++  verify
  =|  test-mode=_|
  |=  [=proof override=(unit (list term)) verifier-eny=@]
  ^-  ?
```
Properties:
- Pure.
- Deterministic once `verifier-eny` is fixed.
- No side effects.
- Crashes on failure.
- Returns boolean externally.
- `verify-inner` internally returns:
```hoon
[commitment=noun-digest:tip5 nonce=noun-digest:tip5]
```
Inside recursive circuit:
```hoon
=/  puzzle  (snag 0 objects.proof)
?>  ?=(%puzzle -.puzzle)
?>  =(commitment.puzzle (block-commitment:page:t our-page))
?>  (verify:sp-verifier block-proof ~ 0)
```
## 8.5 FRI parameters and verifier work
From `common/ztd/eight.hoon`:
```text
log-expand-factor = 6
expand-factor = 64
security-level = 50
num-spot-checks = 50 / 6 = 8
num-rounds ≈ 10–12 for mining-sized traces
```
Typical block proof stream:
```text
12 static
+ num-rounds ≈ 10
+ num-rounds × num-spot-checks ≈ 80
+ 4 × num-spot-checks = 32
≈ 134 items
```
Dominant verifier work:
- Merkle proof verification:
  - `4 × num_spot_checks × log2(fri_domain_len)` Tip5 hashes.
  - For `fri_domain_len ≈ 2^20`, about 640 hashes.
- FRI spot checks:
  - about 80 groups.
- Composition polynomial evaluation.
- DEEP evaluation.
Analytic bound:
```text
1M–10M Nock steps per verify call
```
## 8.6 Block commitment and chain linkage
Both v0 and v1 share the same `hashable-block-commitment` shape:
- parent,
- `hashable-tx-ids`,
- coinbase hash,
- timestamp,
- epoch counter,
- target,
- accumulated work,
- height,
- msg.
The leading `version=%1` tag on v1 does not participate in the hash.
The circuit can call:
```hoon
block-commitment:page:t
```
It dispatches correctly.
Digest linkage:
```text
hashable-digest = [?(~|pow-hash) block-commitment-hashable]
```
The follower supplies parent headers. The circuit cues and rehashes links.
## 8.7 Z-set membership is cheap
`tx-ids` is a balanced z-set keyed by Tip5 hash.
`has:z-in` walks the tree.
For ~2¹¹ transactions:
```text
~11 tree-node visits
low hundreds of Nock steps
```
Decision:
> Use `has:z-in` directly. No separate inclusion-proof shape required.
## 8.8 Vesl-style proofs and Nockchain block proofs are not interchangeable
Hard finding from Phase 1-redo:
- `verify:nock-verifier` reconstructs `[subject formula]` via `puzzle-nock`.
- Vesl prover traces arbitrary `[subject formula]`.
- Therefore:
  - Vesl proofs verify with Vesl verifier.
  - Nockchain block PoW proofs verify with `sp-verifier`.
  - They are not interchangeable.
Attempting to verify Vesl-style proof with `sp-verifier` fails at composition evaluation because the reconstructed computation differs.
Compatibility boundary:
```text
vesl proofs        ↔ vesl-stark-verifier
block PoW proofs   ↔ sp-verifier
```
This is fine because Phase 3 recursion verifies Nockchain block PoW proofs, which are puzzle-nock-derived.
## 8.9 Baseline NNS prover measurements
Reproduce:
```bash
cargo +nightly test --release --test prover \
  phase0_baseline_prove_and_verify -- --nocapture --ignored
```
Hardware:
- Apple Silicon dev laptop.
- macOS.
- Release build.
- `NockStackSize::Large`.
Batch:
- one claim for `alpha.nock`.
- Kernel folds JAM’d batch into Goldilocks belt digest.
- Proves 64 nested Nock-4 increments over it.
Measured:
| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| `%prove-batch` wall-clock | 4.758 s |
| cargo process wall-clock | 81 s |
| proof JAM bytes | 76,488 B |
| peak RSS | 1.157 GB |
| peak memory footprint | 162 MB |
| retired instructions | 5.23 × 10⁹ |
| voluntary context switches | 6,169 |
| effects | `%batch-settled`, `%batch-proof`, `%vesl-settled` |
Surprise:
- Much better than Vesl forge’s 600-second / 128 GB reference.
- Reasons:
  - NNS baseline batch is tiny.
  - Apple Silicon hits prover jets well.
Expected x86 Linux slowdown:
```text
2–5×
```
## 8.10 Phase 1-redo measurements
Reproduce:
```bash
cargo +nightly test --release --test prover \
  phase1_redo_verify_inner_proof_wall_clock -- --nocapture --ignored
```
Built:
- Vendored then later unvendored Vesl verifier libraries.
- `%verify-stark blob=*`
- `%prove-identity ~`
- Kernel `last-proved=(unit [subject=@ formula=*])`
- Rust builders/extractors:
  - `build_verify_stark_poke`
  - `build_prove_identity_poke`
Measurements:
| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| `%prove-batch` | 4.720 s |
| proof JAM | 76,879 B |
| peak RSS | 1.116 GB |
| `%verify-stark` | 0.605 s |
| verify/prove ratio | 0.13× |
| sequential prove + verify | 5.325 s |
Verifier work is what recursive outer trace must prove.
Updated projection:
| Projected recursive metric | Low | High |
|---|---:|---:|
| wall-clock | ~8 s | ~25 s |
| peak memory | ~2 GB | ~5 GB |
| proof JAM | ~150 KiB | ~300 KiB |
Caveats:
- Measured proof was NNS Vesl-style, not Nockchain block PoW.
- Expect ±30% variance for real block proof.
- `%prove-identity` sanity arm fails on degenerate table heights.
- Apple Silicon likely faster than x86 Linux.
- Peak RSS may rise to 10–15 GB if outer trace must hold full inner proof plus polynomial structures.
Decision:
> GO on per-batch recursion; keep per-claim recursion in scope.
## 8.11 Batched recursion remains preferred
Verifier-inside-trace cost is mostly fixed per block proof.
Therefore:
- One outer proof verifying one block proof and N claims amortizes cost.
- Settlement batch is the natural unit.
- Wallet verifies one settlement-level STARK per name lookup.
Per-claim recursion is viable but not necessary for throughput.
## 8.12 Anchoring compromise
NNS does not verify every block PoW up to the tip.
Instead:
1. Verify PoW STARK of the block containing the payment.
2. Verify cheap parent-hash linkage from that block to NNS anchor.
3. Wallet checks NNS anchor against its own Nockchain view.
This is analogous to L2 rollups trusting L1 consensus rather than re-verifying L1 internally.
---
# 9. Phase 3 predicate and claim-proof implementation
## 9.1 Level A predicates
`hoon/lib/nns-predicates.hoon` added:
- `++fee-for-name`
  - mirrors Rust `payment::fee_for_name`.
- `++chain-links-to`
  - walks oldest-first `(list anchor-header)`.
  - checks parent pointer chain from claim block digest to follower anchored tip.
Kernel exposes:
- peek:
```text
/fee-for-name/<name>
```
- cause:
```hoon
%verify-chain-link claim-digest headers anchored-tip
```
Effect:
```hoon
[%chain-link-result ok=?]
```
Rust wiring:
- poke builders,
- decoders,
- result extractors in `src/kernel.rs`.
Tests:
- 2 fee-for-name cases:
  - 15-row parity table,
  - long-name sanity.
- 7 chain-link cases:
  - claim is tip,
  - empty-chain wrong tip,
  - happy 3-header chain,
  - first-parent mismatch,
  - internal break,
  - height gap,
  - wrong final tip.
## 9.2 Level B tx-inclusion predicates
`zoon.hoon` was safe to symlink standalone because it only imports `/common/zeke`.
Added to `scripts/setup-hoon-tree.sh`.
`nns-predicates.hoon` added:
- `has-tx-in-page`
  - walks `tx-ids.page` as `(z-set @ux)` via `has:z-in`.
- `matches-block-digest`
  - equality check against hull’s `BlockDetails.block_id`.
Uses minimal type:
```hoon
+$  nns-page-summary
  [digest=@ux tx-ids=(z-set @ux)]
```
This avoids importing full `block-commitment:page:t`, which currently requires the blocked `tx-engine` cone.
Kernel cause:
```hoon
%verify-tx-in-page digest tx-ids claimed-tx-id
```
Builds canonical z-set via `z-silt`.
Effect:
```hoon
[%tx-in-page-result ok=?]
```
Rust:
- `build_verify_tx_in_page_poke`
- `first_tx_in_page_result`
Tests:
- 1-byte single.
- 1-byte two-element.
- 8-byte triples accept/reject.
- empty set.
- 40-byte single.
- 40-byte two-element.
Known edge case:
- Jetted `hash-noun-varlen` in `zkvm-jetpack::tip5_jets` crashes when `z-silt` receives 3+ 40-byte atoms with certain handcrafted patterns.
- Smaller vectors work.
- Real Tip5 digests should be well-distributed and not hit handcrafted pattern.
- Upstream jet issue, not a Phase 3c blocker.
## 9.3 Level C predicates
### Level C-A — shipped 2026-04-24 pm
Implemented in `hoon/lib/nns-predicates.hoon` as pure Hoon (no new deps):
- `+$nns-raw-tx-witness`: 4-atom narrow view
  `[tx-id spender-pkh treasury-amount output-lock-root]`.   
- `+matches-tx-id`: witness.tx-id == claim.tx-hash.
- `+pays-sender`: witness.spender-pkh == claim.owner (atom equality).
- `+pays-amount`: witness.treasury-amount >= fee-for-name(claim.name).
- `+matches-treasury`: compared against treasury's public lock hash
  in the `%prove-claim` cause (state-relative, not in the arm).
Kernel wiring:
- `%validate-claim` / `%prove-claim` pokes take four extra witness
  atoms (`witness-tx-id`, `witness-spender-pkh`, `witness-treasury-amount`,
  `witness-output-lock-hash`).
- `validate-claim-bundle` adds three cross-predicate checks:
  `witness-tx-id-mismatch`, `witness-sender-mismatch`, `witness-underpaid`.
- `%prove-claim` cause additionally refuses on `witness-wrong-treasury`
  (witness treasury ≠ kernel state, or kernel treasury unset).
Trust model:
- **Hull trusted** to correctly extract `(tx-id, spender-pkh,
  treasury-amount, output-lock-hash)` from the on-chain raw-tx.
- **Kernel enforces** consistency between the witness, the claim
  tuple, and kernel state (`output-lock-hash`).
- **Wallet verifies** the STARK, then independently fetches the
  raw-tx from Nockchain and re-parses to confirm the witness
  fields match. This makes hull extraction *falsifiable* — a
  lying hull is detected on the wallet side.
Tests in `tests/phase3_predicates.rs`:
- `validate_claim_rejects_witness_tx_id_mismatch`
- `validate_claim_rejects_witness_sender_mismatch`
- `validate_claim_rejects_witness_underpaid`
- `validate_claim_rejects_witness_underpaid_even_when_claim_fee_matches`
- `prove_claim_rejects_wrong_treasury`
- `prove_claim_rejects_when_treasury_unset`
### Level C-B — pending narrow `tx-witness.hoon` vendor
Adds:
- `compute-id:raw-tx` inside the kernel to re-hash the raw-tx and
  verify `witness.tx-id` matches — eliminates the hull's witness-
  extraction trust.
- `matches-block-commitment` via `block-commitment:page:t` — lets
  the kernel re-compute the page digest rather than trust hull.
- `verify:sp-verifier` on a block PoW STARK (recursive gate).
Original attempt to symlink full tx-engine cone hit hoonc dep-loop / OOM:
- `tx-engine-0.hoon` hangs for ~4 minutes and eventually OOMs.
- Root cause: shared `/common/stark/prover` resolution through two different `=> stark-engine` contexts:
  - one from `vesl-prover`,
  - one from `nock-prover` pulled transitively by `pow`.
Plan:
- Vendor narrow subset into `hoon/lib/tx-witness.hoon`.
- Re-export only needed arms:
  - `block-commitment:page:t`
  - `has:z-in` on `tx-ids`
  - `compute-id:raw-tx:t`
  - `spends:raw-tx:v1`
  - `outputs:tx:v1`
- Stub every transitive dep on `tx-engine-0` with narrow types
  mirroring the shapes we need; do NOT pull in `pow` /
  `nock-prover`.
## 9.4 Phase 3c step 1: validator
`nns-predicates.hoon` added:
Types:
- `+$claim-bundle`
- `+$validation-error`
Name-format helpers:
- `is-valid-name`
- `valid-char`
- `all-valid-chars`
- `has-nock-suffix`
- `stem-len`
Validator:
```hoon
++validate-claim-bundle
```
Checks, in order:
1. G1: valid name.
2. C2: fee >= schedule.
3. Level B:
   - `matches-block-digest`
   - `has-tx-in-page`
4. Level A:
   - `chain-links-to`
Short-circuits on first failure.
Kernel cause:
```hoon
%validate-claim
```
Read-only; does not mutate state.
Effects:
```hoon
[%validate-claim-ok]
[%validate-claim-error <tag>]
```
Tags:
- `invalid-name`
- `fee-below-schedule`
- `page-digest-mismatch`
- `tx-not-in-page`
- `chain-broken`
Rust:
- `ClaimBundle`
- `build_validate_claim_poke`
- `ValidateClaimResult`
- `first_validate_claim_result`
Tests:
- happy path,
- each rejection path,
- chain-with-headers,
- short-circuit ordering.
## 9.5 Phase 3c step 2: `%prove-claim`
Kernel cause:
```hoon
%prove-claim
```
Behavior:
1. Runs validator.
2. If validator fails, does not prove.
3. If validator passes:
   - folds `(jam bundle)` into belt digest,
   - runs `prove-computation:vp` under current `(root, hull)`,
   - emits:
```hoon
[%claim-proof bundle-digest proof]
```
Fiat-Shamir binding:
- Bundle digest commitment is bound to `(root, hull)` through Vesl prover puzzle header/nonce absorption.
- A different registry snapshot cannot produce a verifying proof for the same bundle.
Rust:
- `build_prove_claim_poke`
- `ClaimProof`
- `claim_proof`
- `first_claim_proof`
Ignored integration test:
```text
phase3c_prove_claim_roundtrip
```
Metrics:
| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| prove | 4.997 s |
| verify | 615 ms |
| proof JAM | 76,537 B |
| peak RSS | 1.0 GB |
---
# 10. Phase 3c step 3: validator inside the STARK
## 10.1 Goal
Move from:
```text
STARK proves committed bundle digest
wallet re-runs validator
```
to:
```text
STARK proves validator ran and returned Ok
wallet verifies one artifact
```
## 10.2 Foundation landed
Implemented:
- Tip5-free validator variant:
```hoon
validate-claim-bundle-linear
```
- Uses list walk for tx inclusion.
- Avoids Tip5 jets in trace.
General-purpose prover primitive:
```hoon
%prove-arbitrary
```
Accepts caller-supplied JAM’d:
```text
(subject, formula)
```
Cues them, traces with `prove-computation:vp`, emits:
```hoon
[%arbitrary-proof product proof]
```
Test:
```text
tests/prover.rs::phase3c_step3_prove_arbitrary_roundtrip
```
Metrics:
| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| prove | ~610 ms |
| verify | ~602 ms |
## 10.3 Why encoding is not mechanical
Hoon-compiled Nock formulas contain axis references tied to compile-time subject layout.
When hoonc compiles:
```hoon
(validate-claim-bundle-linear bundle)
```
the formula expects:
- `bundle` at a specific sample axis.
- `validate-claim-bundle-linear` at an axis inside the kernel/core tree.
- sub-arms at axes in the `np` core.
If the prover receives only:
```text
subject = bundle
```
axis references break.
## 10.4 Encoding approaches considered
### Approach 1: hand-written Nock
Write validator as direct Nock.
Pros:
- Auditable.
- Avoids compiled Hoon subject issues.
Cons:
- Brittle.
- Hard to maintain.
- Variable-length recursion without Nock 9 is ugly.
Estimated size:
```text
100–300 lines Nock
```
### Approach 2: subject-bundled core
Construct:
```text
subject = [bundle validator-core]
```
Formula:
```hoon
[9 <arm-axis> 10 [6 0 2] 0 3]
```
Meaning:
1. Fetch validator core at axis 3.
2. Replace core sample at axis 6 with bundle at axis 2.
3. Slam validator arm.
Pros:
- Validator Hoon changes propagate automatically.
- Least effort.
Cons:
- Full serialized core in subject.
- Trace larger.
Decision:
> Try approach 2 first.
### Approach 3: formula rebasing pass
Build a tool to rewrite axis references.
Pros:
- General.
- Reusable.
Cons:
- Non-trivial.
- Must understand Nock-9 sample edits, Nock-2 subject changes, etc.
- Probably a week+.
## 10.5 Subject-bundled-core spike landed
In `hoon/lib/nns-predicates.hoon`:
### `++validator-arm-axis`
A `^~`-pinned compile-time constant.
Extracts hoonc’s arm axis for:
```hoon
validate-claim-bundle-linear
```
Uses `!=(arm)` introspection.
Handles:
```hoon
[9 axis core-path]
```
and hint-wrapped:
```hoon
[11 hint [9 axis core-path]]
```
Empirical current axis:
```text
20
```
### `++build-validator-trace-inputs`
Given a `claim-bundle-linear`, returns:
```text
[subject formula]
```
Where:
```text
subject = [bundle np-core]
np-core = ..validate-claim-bundle-linear
```
Formula:
```hoon
[9 2 10 [6 0 2] 9 20 0 3]
```
Important detail:
> The `..arm` idiom is load-bearing.
Using `.` inside the gate body captures the gate’s own sample and breaks axis resolution.
## 10.6 `%prove-claim-in-stark`
Kernel cause:
```hoon
%prove-claim-in-stark
```
Payload shape:
- same as `%validate-claim`
- same as `%prove-claim`
Behavior:
1. Calls `build-validator-trace-inputs`.
2. Dry-runs raw Nock outside STARK:
```hoon
.*(subj form)
```
under `mule`.
3. If dry-run succeeds, hands same pair to `prove-computation:vp`.
Success effect:
```hoon
%claim-in-stark-proof product proof
```
`product` is a head-tagged:
```hoon
(each ~ validation-error)
```
Prover rejection effect:
```hoon
%prove-failed trace
```
Rust wiring:
- `build_prove_claim_in_stark_poke`
- `ClaimInStarkProof`
- `InStarkValidation::{Ok, Rejected(String)}`
- extractors in `src/kernel.rs`
Test:
```text
phase3c_step3_validator_in_stark_blocked_upstream
```
Current result:
- Dry-run succeeds.
- Prover traps.
- Test is green because it expects the upstream blocker.
## 10.7 What the spike proved
1. Encoding is semantically correct.
   - Raw `.*(subj form)` returns `[0 0]`, i.e. `[%& ~]`, for valid bundle.
2. `..validate-claim-bundle-linear` is correct subject capture.
   - `.` variant captures wrong core shape.
3. `validator-arm-axis` is stable at compile time.
   - `^~` bakes it into kernel image.
   - Layout break should fail loudly.
## 10.8 Why Vesl prover traps
Vesl interpreter:
```hoon
common/ztd/eight.hoon::fock:fink:interpret
```
Supports opcodes 0–8 only.
Traps on:
```hoon
[%9 axis=* core=*]              !!
[%10 [axis=@ value=*] target=*] !!
[%11 tag=@ next=*]              !!
[%11 [tag=@ clue=*] next=*]     !!
```
The NNS formula uses:
- Nock 9: slam validator arm.
- Nock 10: edit sample.
Any non-trivial Hoon gate call compiles to Nock 9. Record/sample edits compile to Nock 10. Hints may compile to Nock 11.
Raw nockvm supports all twelve opcodes. Vesl’s STARK interpreter does not because its compute table constraints only model 0–8.
## 10.9 Decision for step 3
Options:
1. Upstream Vesl implements 9/10/11.
2. Hand-encode validator in Nock 0–8.
3. Keep committed-digest design for production.
4. Pre-expand Nock 9/10/11 to the 0–8 subset via a formula rewriter (Hoon-side pass or in-prover).
Chosen:
> Option 3 now; option 1 upstream.
Rationale:
- Upstream opcode support is a Vesl protocol change.
- Hand-encoded Nock adds audit surface.
- Step 2 already provides strong trustlessness with a tiny wallet-side validator call.
- Option 4 attempted and rejected on OOM grounds — see [10.10](#1010-path-3-attempt-formula-rewriting) below.
When upstream lands:
- Flip one assertion in blocker-signal test.
- Wallet drops Rust validator mirror.
## 10.10 Path 3 attempt: formula rewriting
Attempted on **2026-04-24 pm**. Outcome: **rejected, but informative**.
### 10.10.1 Premise
Nock 9, 10, 11 are all semantically expressible via Nock 0–8 + autocons. From the Nock spec:
```text
[9 b c]            = [7 c [2 [0 1] [0 b]]]
[10 [axis v] t]    = nested autocons reconstructing t with axis replaced by v
[11 tag next]      = next         (hint stripped)
[11 [tag clue] d]  = d            (clue evaluated, product discarded)
```
If we pre-expand every Hoon-compiled 9/10/11 before handing the formula to `prove-computation:vp`, the STARK's compute table sees only 0–8 and the trace is valid.
### 10.10.2 Implementation landed
Both variants were implemented and compile cleanly.
Hoon-side rewriter in `hoon/lib/nns-predicates.hoon`:
```hoon
++  normalize-to-0-8   :: structure-preserving rewriter
++  ta-axis            :: T-axis → [T a]-axis map after Nock-8 push
++  rebuild-at-axis    :: general axis-path walk for Nock-10 edit
```
Key design points that made the spike viable:
- Structure-preserving rewrites keep arm positions fixed when normalizing a whole core (`validator-arm-axis` stays valid after normalization).
- Defensive pattern matching per opcode — cells whose head happens to be 0–11 but whose tail doesn't match the expected shape (Nock-1 constants carrying data) fall through unchanged.
- Recursing into Nock-1 constants because hoonc emits gate batteries as `[1 body-formula]` where the body is later slammed.
In-prover variant: patched `fock:fink:interpret` in `hoon/common/ztd/eight.hoon` so every Nock-9/10/11 encountered at trace time gets rewritten inline before the constraint-bound interpreter sees it. This recurses directly through `interpret` with the rewritten formula, so the trace records only 0–8.
### 10.10.3 Findings
1. **Both rewriters are semantically correct.** Raw `.*(subj form)` on a rewritten formula returns `[%& ~]` for a valid bundle. Round-tripping an isolated `[11 [%fast <clue>] [0 1]]` test vector through `normalize-to-0-8` produces `[7 [0 1] [0 1]]`, semantically identical and structure-preserving.
2. **The Hoon-side whole-core pass completes, but the prover still traps at runtime** — because every `[9 axis core]` rewrites to `[7 core [2 [0 1] [0 axis]]]`, which at trace time fetches the arm body via Nock-2. That body may itself contain Nock-9/10/11 that wasn't reached by our static walk (e.g., sub-cores in the validator's transitive closure). Normalizing the whole `nns-predicates` core exhaustively is O(core-size) and still leaves dynamically-reached formulas untouched.
3. **The in-prover variant OOM'd on a real validator bundle.** The recursive rewrite expands each Nock-9 gate call into a full arm-body trace, each of which expands each of its Nock-9 sub-calls, and so on. For a four-predicate validator (`is-valid-name`, `fee-for-name`, `has-tx-in-list`, `chain-links-to`) the rewrite-expanded trace exceeded available memory on a dev laptop. Trace size grows geometrically with call depth, while the 0–8 compute table was designed for straight-line Nock.
### 10.10.4 Why this is an upstream-only problem
The OOM is not an implementation bug. It's a **design consequence** of Vesl's compute table modeling only 0–8:
- Nock 9 semantically *is* `[7 c [2 [0 1] [0 b]]]`, so expanding is correct. But the expanded form re-evaluates `c` (the core fetch), pushes a Nock-2, and runs the arm. Under fink's constraint-bound interpreter, every Nock-2 is a separate trace row with full subject/formula context. Nested gate calls multiply row counts.
- The only way to prove Nock-9 at constant cost is a **native compute-table row** for it — with constraints that model "evaluate core formula once, then run arm N of core with core as subject" in a single step. That's proper STARK circuit work, not formula rewriting.
- Same logic for Nock-10 (edit).
- Nock-11 could arguably be erased in trace (it's a product no-op), but adding that as a constraint-column rule is still a Vesl change.
This confirms the Phase 8 upstream ask is the right lever.
### 10.10.5 What was kept, what was reverted
| Artifact | State | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `hoon/common/ztd/eight.hoon` in-prover patch | **reverted** | vendored Vesl code; OOM'd; upstream's call |
| `+normalize-to-0-8`, `+ta-axis`, `+rebuild-at-axis` in `nns-predicates.hoon` | **kept as dormant artifacts** | correct structure-preserving rewriter; future reuse if a different prover route appears |
| `+build-validator-trace-inputs`, `+validator-arm-axis` | **kept (hot path)** | produces the subject-bundled-core encoding; used by `%prove-claim-in-stark` |
| `%prove-claim-in-stark` cause in `hoon/app/app.hoon` | **kept** | emits `%prove-failed <trace>` on the upstream trap; unchanged |
| `phase3c_step3_validator_in_stark_blocked_upstream` test | **kept, green** | documents the blocker shape; flips to positive when upstream lands |
The dormant rewriter compiles clean with the current kernel and is available if a future avenue — a different prover backend, or a Hoon-side partial evaluator — wants to consume it.
### 10.10.6 Takeaway for Phase 8
When upstream Vesl adds native Nock 9/10/11:
- Compute-table rows for `%9` (slam), `%10` (edit), `%11` (hint strip).
- Constraint equations that model the opcodes directly, not via expansion.
- Expected verifier-side cost: small, bounded per opcode.
- Expected prover-side cost: bounded per occurrence (not geometric).
The blocker-signal test in `tests/prover.rs` is the only NNS-side code that needs to flip when the upstream change lands.

Status: **shipped**.
Moved patches upstream on local Vesl branch:
```text
phase1-verifier-debug-and-type-fix
commit dc9382c
```
Patches:
- Type-narrow `verify-settlement` mule unwrap:
```hoon

```
to:
```hoon
?.  ?=(%& -.result)
```
- Add `++verify-raw` for debug tracing.
Deleted five vendored copies:

```
`scripts/setup-hoon-tree.sh` now symlinks from:
```text
$VESL_HOME/protocol/lib/
```
Kernel recompiles unchanged:
```text
~19 MB JAM
```
## 11.4 Phase 2: claim-note schema and chain-input plumbing
Status: **shipped**.
### Kernel state
Added:
```hoon
anchored-chain = [tip-digest tip-height]
payment-address = (unit @t)
```
Causes:
```hoon
%advance-tip headers=(list anchor-header)
%set-payment-address address=@t
```
Peeks:
```text
/anchor
/payment-address
```
Rules:
- `%advance-tip` validates parent-chain integrity.
- Intermediate headers discarded.
- `%set-payment-address` freezes after first claim.
### Rust wiring
Builders and decoders:
- `build_advance_tip_poke`
- `build_set_payment_address_poke`
- `build_anchor_peek`
- `build_payment_address_peek`
- `decode_anchor`
- `decode_payment_address`
- `first_anchor_advanced`
- `first_payment_address_set`
Extended:
- `error_message`
### Config
New module:
```text
src/config.rs
```
Resolution order:
```text
CLI > env > TOML > compiled-in default
```
Config:
```text
payment_address
```
`main.rs` issues bootstrap `%set-payment-address`.
### Chain fetchers
In `src/chain.rs`:
- `fetch_block_details_by_height`
- `fetch_block_proof_bytes`
- `fetch_transaction_details`
- `fetch_page_for_tx`
- `fetch_header_chain`
- `fetch_current_tip_height`
- `plan_anchor_advance`
Conversions:
- `hash_to_atom_bytes`
- `atom_bytes_to_hash`
These convert between:
```text
gRPC common.v1.Hash = 5 × u64 Belts
```
and:
```text
40-byte LE-packed noun-digest:tip5 atom
```
### Follower
Added anchor advance task:
```text
advance_anchor_once
```
Runs every 10 seconds.
Uses:
```text
DEFAULT_FINALITY_DEPTH = 10
DEFAULT_MAX_ADVANCE_BATCH = 64
```
### Claim note schema
`ClaimNoteV1` extended with optional:
```rust
ClaimChainBundle {
    raw_tx_jam,
    page_jam,
    block_proof_jam,
    header_chain_jam,
}
```
Wire keys:
- `nns/v1/raw-tx`
- `nns/v1/page`
- `nns/v1/block-proof`
- `nns/v1/header-chain`
Missing fields decode as `None`.
`chain_bundle.is_complete()` used by strict future modes.
### Tests
`tests/phase2_anchor.rs` covers:
- bootstrap,
- extend,
- parent mismatch,
- height gap,
- internal break,
- empty advance,
- address one-shot bind,
- pre-claim re-bind,
- post-claim freeze.
Claim-note unit tests:
- chain-bundle roundtrip,
- backward compatibility,
- optional field behavior.
## 11.5 Slim-anchor refactor
Status: **shipped**.
Changed kernel anchor from:
```text
[tip-digest tip-height recent-headers=(list anchor-header)]
```
to:
```text
[tip-digest tip-height]
```
Removed:
- 1,024-entry header deque.
- `max-anchor-headers`.
- unused cached header storage.
Storage savings:
- up to ~90 KB per kernel instance.
- typical savings ~88 bytes per advanced header.
Rust:
- `AnchorView` dropped `recent_headers`.
- `decode_anchor` simplified to two atoms.
- tests updated from `recent_headers.len()` to `tip_digest` equality.
Design rationale captured inline:
> NNS commits to one Nockchain tip; wallets trust Nockchain independently.
## 11.6 Phase 3: ChainFollower
Status: **partially shipped**.
Shipped:
- background follower,
- deterministic replay ordering,
- same-block ordering via:
```text
(block_height, tx_index_in_block)
```
using:
- `GetTransactionBlock`
- `GetBlockDetails`
Still pending:
- persist follower cursor + block reference,
- reorg-safe rewind + replay from checkpoints,
- chain-native claim-note discovery,
- replacement of local submission-queue replay.
## 11.7 Phase 4: source-of-truth flip
Status: **partially shipped**.
Shipped:
- remove direct `%claim` poke from request path.
- serve pending/confirmed/rejected through status APIs.
Still pending:
- complete strict chain-native replay path.
## 11.8 Phase 5: `nns-gate` transition-proof upgrade
Status: **pending / partially covered by Phase 3c proof work**.
Remaining:
- extend gate input shape to carry transition context,
- validate per-claim transitions in gate:
  - C1–C4 over ordered transitions,
  - not just inclusion,
- bind transition proof output to chain-verifiable anchor.
## 11.9 Phase 6: light-client verification surface
Status: **partially shipped**.
Shipped:
- expand `/proof` payload with transition-proof metadata.
- standalone verifier entrypoint.
Pending:
- emit/serve real final `transition_proof` bytes for complete transition proof.
- wallet-ready verification guide.
- reference flow verifying:
  - inclusion proof,
  - transition proof,
  - chain anchor,
  - freshness.
## 11.10 Phase 7: staleness / fork resistance
Status: **shipped 2026-04-24 pm**.
See [Phase 7 acceptance criteria](#76-phase-7-acceptance-criteria) for per-item status. Summary of what landed:
- Hoon: `+$claim-bundle` + `+$claim-bundle-linear` each gain `anchored-tip-height=@ud`; `+matches-current-anchor` predicate; `%anchor-mismatch` validation error.
- Kernel cause `%prove-claim` rejects before proving when the bundle's anchor disagrees with kernel state.
- Rust: `ClaimBundle` gains `anchored_tip_height`; `src/freshness.rs` exposes `Freshness`, `FreshnessError`, `check_anchor_binding`, `AnchorBindingError`; `ProofResponse` gains `anchor: Option<ProofAnchor>`; `/proof` handler peeks `/anchor` and populates it.
- Binary: `src/bin/light_verify.rs` rewritten with `--chain-tip`, `--max-staleness`, `--chain-tip-digest`, `--no-freshness` flags and precise exit codes.
- Tests: 13 freshness unit + 2 anchor-mismatch kernel + 8 CLI integration + 2 two-server integration = 25 Phase-7-specific tests, all green.
## 11.11 Phase 8: upstream Vesl prover Nock 9/10/11
Status: **pending upstream**.
Tasks:
- File upstream ask to extend:
```hoon
common/ztd/eight.hoon::fock:fink:interpret
```
for:
- Nock 9: slam,
- Nock 10: edit,
- Nock 11: hint.
Priority:
1. Nock 9.
2. Nock 10.
3. Nock 11.
Shipping Nock 9 alone likely unlocks NNS if subject construction avoids `%10`.
After upstream merge:
- re-bench `phase3c_step3_validator_in_stark_blocked_upstream`,
- convert it to positive end-to-end test,
- drop wallet Rust validator mirror.
---
# 12. Current todo backlog
## 12.1 Highest priority
- **Phase 7 freshness check**:
  - proof bundle top-level `t_nns_digest`,
  - proof bundle top-level `t_nns_height`,
  - public STARK output commitment,
  - `light_verify` freshness rejection,
  - docs,
  - two-server stale-proof integration test.
- **Level C payment semantics**:
  - `matches-block-commitment`,
  - `pays-sender`,
  - `pays-amount`,
  - narrow `tx-witness.hoon`.
- **Follower durability**:
  - cursor persistence,
  - block reference persistence,
  - reorg rewind,
  - checkpoint replay.
- **Chain-native claim-note discovery**:
  - replace reliance on local submission queue.
## 12.2 Phase 3 / proof todos
- Vendor narrow `hoon/lib/tx-witness.hoon`.
- Avoid full `pow → nock-prover → stark/prover` cone.
- Complete C5:
  - sender pkh,
  - recipient/payment address,
  - amount >= fee.
- Embed `verify:sp-verifier` over block PoW proof.
- Add full recursive settlement proof.
- Map new kernel error tags in hull/follower.
## 12.3 Wallet / SDK todos
- Rewrite `src/bin/light_verify.rs`.
- Add `MaxStaleness`.
- Verify:
  - inclusion proof,
  - STARK proof,
  - bundle digest,
  - validator result or local mirror,
  - chain anchor,
  - freshness.
- Document gRPC source for wallet chain tip.
- Add reference wallet verification flow.
## 12.4 Operator todos
- `/status` anchor lag.
- `/status` old `Submitted` claims.
- structured follower failure tracing.
- optional Prometheus export.
---
# 13. Known risks and edge cases
## 13.1 Prover throughput
If registrations arrive faster than proofs can be produced, queue grows.
Mitigations:
- tune settlement batch cadence,
- batch recursion,
- parallel proof generation.
## 13.2 Hardware lockout
Recursive proving may require high-memory machines.
Current projection:
```text
2–5 GB likely
10–15 GB possible
```
This is acceptable for app-level proving if verification remains cheap.
## 13.3 Nockchain STARK format drift
Mitigation:
- pin `ztd/*`,
- vendor narrow verifier/tx-engine arms,
- avoid silent upstream breakage.
## 13.4 Anchor freshness tuning
Too strict:
- rejects honest lagging servers.
Too loose:
- widens malicious stale proof window.
Default:
```text
20 blocks
```
## 13.5 `hash-noun-varlen` jet crash
Known upstream edge:
- `z-silt` with 3+ handcrafted 40-byte atoms can crash jetted `hash-noun-varlen`.
- Real Tip5 digests expected safe.
- Not a Phase 3c blocker.
## 13.6 Open measurement questions
Still need / previously listed:
- Nockchain block time under realistic load.
  - target acceptable upper bound around 15s for claim UX.
- Chain gas pricing relative to NNS fee tiers:
  - 100,
  - 500,
  - 5000 nocks.
- realistic reorg depth.
- bootstrapping new NNS nodes:
  - full replay from genesis,
  - or trust-minimized snapshot / STARK checkpoint.
- arbitrary-data note filter conventions if chain API lacks first-class tagged note filters.

# 14. Upstream Vesl issue draft
Title:
> Extend `fock:fink:interpret` to Nock opcodes 9, 10, 11
Context:
NNS Phase 3c aims to prove bundle validation inside the STARK so light clients verify a single proof instead of:
```text
proof + digest check + Rust validator mirror
```
Observation:
`common/ztd/eight.hoon::fock:fink:interpret` traps on Nock opcodes 9, 10, 11:
```hoon
[%9 axis=* core=*]              !!
[%10 [axis=@ value=*] target=*] !!
[%11 tag=@ next=*]              !!
[%11 [tag=@ clue=*] next=*]     !!
```
Raw nockvm supports all twelve opcodes. The STARK interpreter only handles 0–8.
Impact:
- Any Hoon gate call compiles to Nock 9.
- Any sample/record edit compiles to Nock 10.
- Hoon hints may emit Nock 11.
- Non-trivial Hoon validators cannot currently be traced by Vesl prover.
- Formula-rewriting to the 0–8 subset (either Hoon-side pre-expansion or inline rewrites inside `fock:fink:interpret`) is semantically correct but produces geometric trace blowup from recursive Nock-9 arm-body expansion. Empirically OOM'd on a four-predicate validator. Native compute-table rows for `%9`/`%10`/`%11` are the only path that keeps prover cost bounded per opcode occurrence.
Repro in NNS:
```bash
cargo test --test prover \
  phase3c_step3_validator_in_stark_blocked_upstream \
  -- --ignored --nocapture
```
This confirms:
- raw `.*(subj form)` succeeds,
- STARK prover traps with stack through `eight.hoon:808`.
Specific asks:
1. **Nock 9: slam**
   Trace decomposition:
   ```text
   core → arm-formula → subject-for-arm → recurse
   ```
   Shipping `%9` alone likely unlocks NNS.
2. **Nock 10: edit**
   Noun surgery:
   ```text
   target with axis replaced by value
   ```
3. **Nock 11: hint**
   Can likely be erased semantically in trace if preferred.
Downstream effect:
- NNS blocker test becomes green end-to-end validator-in-STARK test.
- Wallet SDK drops ~150-line Rust validator mirror.
Final current production rule until upstream lands:
```text
Use Phase 3c step 2:
  STARK verify
  + bundle digest check
  + wallet-side validator
  + Phase 7 freshness check before production
```
